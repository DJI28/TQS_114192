### Mockito Warning
```
Mockito will warn (thrwoing an error) if there are more expectations then the ones being used for testing, to avoid these warnings we can set the strictness to lenient which will return no erros. Also if we try to use a mock that is not defined it will just return 0 thwrowing no error or warning.
```

### AI Code for Most Valuable Stocks
```
The code generated by AI (GitHub Copilot) for this function although it seemed correct after some tests it did not propely cover edge cases, when the parameter passed was 0 or below and its size was bigger then the size of the portfolio. For all the tests to pass I modified the function given by AI this is highlited in the code.

### Maven Lifecycle

```
$ mvn test
Only runs unit tests.
$ mvn package
Only runs unit tests.
$ mvn package -DskipTests=true
Does the same as package, but because the -DskipTests=true flag tests will not be performed. 
$ mvn failsafe:integration-test
Only runs integration tests.
$ mvn install
Only runs unit tests.

test, package, install will only perform unit tests because the plugin responsible for integration tests will not be initiated (failsafe) which is required to run IT tests.

failsafe:integration-test will only perform IT tests because it uses the plugin designed for these tests, it will run the tests but expects a prior build step.
